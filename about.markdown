Hey there, I'm Arshad, and I've recently started learning Python. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while, and I finally decided to take the plunge. Over the next few months, I’ve set myself some interesting goals—like building my own website, creating apps from scratch, and exploring data manipulation and Machine Learning.

Why now? I’ve had enough of scrolling through TV shows in the evenings, and I want to do something more productive. Plus, I’m hoping these skills will be useful in my day-to-day work. Wish me luck!
