Python is an awesome language to learn because its syntax is almost as intuitive as everyday English. A perfect example of this simplicity is the classic `Hello, World!` programâ€”it's as straightforward as telling the computer what to say!


{% highlight ruby %}
print("hello world")

#=> prints 'hello world'
{% endhighlight %}
